We’re coming with our 💪🏼Men-only party💪🏼 and a new concept: **SIN CITY**. We’re gonna take over the Bar Rouge and entirely relook it for the night. Plus, we’re inviting [Black Flamingo](http://woofmenonly.com/dj/black-flamingo/) from Madrid as guest DJ, **Paco** is coming back(WOOF Luxembourg 17) with **Manuel Scalco** (WOOF Paris 2) to put you on fire.

We’ll use the 2 floors of the venue, with a brand new second bar upstairs and videos 🔥.

👺The event will be a private party, a totally privatised venue with only men and bouncer at doors. Say bye-bye to the glass doors. You’ll be totally anonymous from the outside 😜
