After nearly a year of closure, Wicki Beach is coming back in a new location, free of any issues with the neighbourhood, simply because they set their new home in Belval, Esch-sur-Alzette, on the other side of the train track of nothing else than the Rockhal.

They hire an architecture cabinet and build an amazing concept, industrial-beach, to keep with the Belval historic past. Using big cargo containers, they create the canva of the artifical beach and put tons of sands, set up bars, grills, DJ-booth and amazing sound system.

To celebrate the grand re-opening, they invited [Lost Frequencies](http://lostfrequencies.com/) to come playing all the evening and night there and I'm more than please to have been ask to do the first act of FÃ©lix De Laet!

Belgian DJ and record producer, he is best known for his singles "Are You with Me" in 2014 and "Reality" in 2015. Deep & Tropical house with a touch of synth, he's now releasing tracks under the famous label [Armada Music](http://www.armadamusic.nl/) from Armin Van Buuren.
