Scott's Pub is located in the heart of Luxembourg City down in the picturesque, medieval valley named the "Grund"...

This Pub was established in 1985 and has since been a great meeting place for generations of people of all age groups and backgrounds. It is today still a very popular hot-spot where you can go out and mingle with a fun, international crowd of people. On weekends enjoy hit music, both old and new, played by our DJ's or live-bands. On weekdays you can sit back in a chilled atmosphere on our spacious sunny terrace, one of the best terraces in Luxembourg, and enjoy the view of the River Alzette right in front you, surrounded by quaint, old buildings and the remains of the old castle walls far away from the noise of traffic and modern life. And yet you're only 5 minutes walk from the center of Luxembourg...
